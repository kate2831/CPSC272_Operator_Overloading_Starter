/**
 * @brief Main function demonstrating ServiceAccount operator overloading
 * 
 * This program demonstrates the functionality of the ServiceAccount class,
 * specifically testing the overloaded equality (==) and greater-than (>) operators.
 * 
 * The program creates two ServiceAccount objects and compares them using
 * custom operators that compare based on account balance.
 * 
 * @return 0 on successful execution
